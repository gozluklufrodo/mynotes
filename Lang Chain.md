1. Core of Lang Chain is large language models
2. You can create very cool apps using alms very quickly
3. Used text-davinci-003
4. The `LLMChain` is a simple chain that takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input and returns the response from an LLM.
5. `SimpleSequentialChain` is like a pipeline, where you can put a lot of chains as list and output of one chain will be an input to another
6. `OpenAIModerationChain` can be used to moderate the output of language model. To check if there is violent speech or not. This sucks. When I input `you are an idiot` it does not return an error
7.
