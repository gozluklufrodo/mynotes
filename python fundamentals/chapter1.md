**Fork on github:** To copy someone elses project and make your changes to that project. You can also start with someone else's project by forking it, then add their licence. 

## Python implementations:

Cpython:  reference implementation, written in C. This is the standard python implementation

PyPy: Faster implementation compared to the cpython

Jython: Python implementation to work with java

IronPython: Python implementation to work with .net 

PythonNet: Python implementation to work with .net

## Pipenv and Virtual Environments

### **Pipenv**:

Dependency manager for python projects. 

Manages dependencies on a per-project basis. 

```
 pipenv install requests
```

--> this command will install requests library and create a Pipfile file where all the dependencies will be added.

```
pipenv run python main.py 
```

--> this way we run the main script. We add pipenv before, to ensure installed pipenv packages are available to the python script. Ä°f we do not add pipenv before, libraries installed by pipenv for this project will not be accessible to the python script.

### **Virtualenv**

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv testing
```

--> installs virtualenv and creates a virtualenv named testing in the given directory.

```
to activate: source testing/bin/activate
```

### VirtualEnvWrapper

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
export WORKON_HOME=~/ENVS
source ./local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

first command installs virtualenvwrapper.

second command exports its main directory where all the created virtual environments will be installed.

third command activates the virtual environment wrapper

```
mkvirtualenv venv --> creates a virtual environment named venv in ENVS folder
workon venv --> activates the venv virtual environment
```

# Python BASICS

- Is a dynamically typed laguage. Object's suitability for a context is determined on runtime.

- Also strongly type language, there is no implicit conversion. Meaning you can not add string and int it will give **TYPE ERROR**

- <u>**<mark>DO NOT USE MUTABLE OBJECTS SUCH AS LISTS AS DEFAULT ARGUMENTS TO A METHOD</mark>**</u>

- Is an interpreted language. --> But compiled to bytecode before it is executed

- PEP8 --> python coding standards

- PEP20 --> zen of python. just type **import this** 

- ```
  import math
  help(math) --> returns any documentation for math module
  ```

- ```
  float("inf")
  float("nan")    --> converts these to floats
  float("-inf")
  ```

- - [x] Whenever you see nested if statement, fix it using elif.
