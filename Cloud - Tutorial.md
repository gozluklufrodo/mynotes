#### Cloud Service Models

1. On Premise
2. IaaS - Infrasctructure as a service. Such as compute engine. Only the hardware is provided for you. You need to do the rest.
3. PaaS - Platform as a service. For example amazon sagemaker is pass, because both hardware and software is provided by the platform and you only responsible for writing your code.
4. SaaS - Software as a service. End user is the user. Any online application.
