Cpython:  reference implementation, written in C. This is the standard python implementation

PyPy: Faster implementation compared to the cpython

Jython: Python implementation to work with java

IronPython: Python implementation to work with .net 

PythonNet: Python implementation to work with .net

## Pipenv and Virtual Environments

### **Pipenv**:

Dependency manager for python projects. 

Manages dependencies on a per-project basis. 

```
 pipenv install requests
```

--> this command will install requests library and create a Pipfile file where all the dependencies will be added.

```
pipenv run python main.py 
```

--> this way we run the main script. We add pipenv before, to ensure installed pipenv packages are available to the python script. Ä°f we do not add pipenv before, libraries installed by pipenv for this project will not be accessible to the python script.

### **Virtualenv**

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv testing
```

--> installs virtualenv and creates a virtualenv named testing in the given directory.

```
to activate: source testing/bin/activate
```

### VirtualEnvWrapper

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
export WORKON_HOME=~/ENVS
source ./local/bin/virtualenwrapper.sh
```

first command installs virtualenvwrapper.

second command exports its main directory where all the created virtual environments will be installed.

third command activates the virtual environment wrapper

```
mkvirtualenv venv --> creates a virtual environment named venv in ENVS folder
workon venv --> activates the venv virtual environment
```
