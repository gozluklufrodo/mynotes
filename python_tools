1. Python-dotenv
example: create a .env file consisting of:
        # Development settings
        DOMAIN=example.org
        ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@${DOMAIN}
        ROOT_URL=${DOMAIN}/app

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv('.env')  # take environment variables from .env.

this will call the .env file and the parameters in the .env will be as if they are environmental variables


2. If you encounter memory-related issues in a Python application, 
you can use the built-in gc (garbage collector) module to diagnose and fix memory leaks,
as well as tools like memory_profiler and tracemalloc to help you identify the parts of your code
that are consuming the most memory.
