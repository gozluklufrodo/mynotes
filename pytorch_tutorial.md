# Deep Learning / ML Basics

- In classical machine learning we were giving features to the model and using that it discriminates between different data and classifies them to different categories. However, in deep learning, the model decides which features to look at and finds out those features that were given by us before.

- This is not to say that feature engineering has no place in deep learning; we often need to inject some form of prior knowledge to deep learning models.

- First import thing about pytorch is it provides multidimensional arrays named tensors with waste amount of operations, and ability to easily move from cpu to gpu. 

- Second important thing is that it uses autograd engine to track the operations on tensors and compute derivatives with respect to any inputs.
